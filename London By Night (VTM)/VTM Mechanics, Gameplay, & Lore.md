## Lore

### Sects of Kindred
- The Camarilla no longer has control over Berlin or London. In many cities the Anarchs and Camarilla mingle uneasily
- Even established Camarilla cities have Anarch enclaves
- **THE ANARCH MOVEMENT IS NOT UNIVERSAL**. It can be whatever people who align themselves with it want it to be, not necessarily for good or bad. It is simply people who don't align with the Camarilla

#### Camarilla
"Old money", this is a political group of kindred created to preserve the masquerade. It is a conspiracy to preserve the power of the elders, and acts much like a secret society. They influence global business and politics and are the closest thing the kindred have to a government, with a union of cities similar to the United Nations. They have a central inner circle and a cadre of justiciars and archons who travel to "keep the peace". Many members of the camarilla cling to their living religions and don't believe Caine to be the true progenitor of all Kindred. They believe him to be a myth or a metaphor for their curse. However, Ancestor worship is common. In the Camarilla summary justice is the norm, and is enacted by  a sheriff, gendarme, constable or other law enforcement officer that acts more like a hitman than anything else. **Chicago is the greatest Camarilla city in the US**. Sometimes referred to as the Ivory Tower.
- Chronicle themes: uses of power, dead hand of the past, safety and duty vs honor and freedom
- typical clans: ventrue, toreador, nosferatu, malkavian, tremere, dissidents from bruja and gangrel
- coterie types: cerberus, commando, day watch, hunting party, marechal, plumaires, questari, regency, sbirri, vehme, watchmen

#### Anarch
All thin-blooded, caitiff, and autarkis vampires are considered Anarch by the Camarilla. They used to be a part of the Camarilla but a civil war ensued causing them to split due to differences in opinion. The anarchs oppose the tyrrany of the elders and fight for their own freedom. The common question asked by anarchs is "why do you obey?".
- chronicle themes: changing society, life under serveillance, ideology vs actuality, the price of revolution
- typical clans: brujah, gangrel, dissidents from camarilla clans, caitiff
- coterie types: blood cult, champions, commando, fang gang, nomads, questari, sbirri, watchmen

#### Autarkis
Often considered members of the anarch movement nowadays, the Autarkis are unaligned Kindred who try to avoid vampire politics in general. A known Autarkis city is Yerevan, Armenia.

### The Second Inquisition
- The Vatican's Society of St. Leopold runs part of the Second Inquisition
- The Inquisition has killed the princes in London and Las Vegas, and crippled a clan in Vienna
- The Second Inquisition is composed mostly of different intelligence agencies ("some of the most morally corrupt organizations on the planet") around the world who are aware of the existance of kindred
- **Who are the Five Eyes???** They added vampiric keywords to an electronic red flag list, making it dangerous for kindred to use electronics
- **SchreckNET**, an online chat platform for kindred, was dismantled because the Second Inquisition found it and gained a lot of information from it, even about individual Kindred. After this incident, Nosferatu hackers began to completely wipe the internet of all kindred communication and information. Nowadays, in the Camarilla any kindred caught contacting other kindred online are banished and threatened with a blood hunt.

### The History of Kindred
- Many emperors in ancient times were kindred
- Antediluvians: the first vampires that were members of clans, thought to be created by Caine
- Enoch: the first kindred city
- Vampires ruled the earth through the Dark ages, then went into hiding after the first inquisition

### Important Ideas
- Elder Kindred are often frozen in time and find it difficult to adjust to the modern world, while the youngest kindred have to deal with them and their outdated beliefs constantly (like having to live with your grandma all the time, but worse)

### Important Terms
- **Jyhad**: the endless struggle between ancient vampires, using the younger vampires as pawns in their endless schemes. This is the driving force of kindred politics
- **Inheritance Coteries**: coteries who inherited territory from their elders who have gone into hiding. They generally don't want to give up this land after it is given to them
- **The Masquerade**: rule number 1 in vampire society - keep vampires a secret from humans. Breaking the masquerade is punishable by death
- **The Domain**: a key tradition in kindred society, basically saying that your domain is your own concern and others owe you respect while in your domain, as well as vice versa. Whatever you say in your domain goes
- **The Progeny**: a Camarilla law that states that kindred may only sire others with permission from their elders on pain of death, and those childe are your responsibility until they know enough to make their own decisons and you **release**  them. A sire has total control over their childe until they are released, but any sins of the childe fall on the sire during that time.
- **Hospitality**: A rule in kindred society that kindred are required to present themselves to the ruler of a foreign domain once they enter it. This is not followed as closely in modern nights as it once was.
- **Destruction**: in Camarilla society it is illegal to kill another kindred, and the only one who can call a blood hunt is an elder

*See page 59 of the corebook for more vampire-related terms*


## Gameplay

### Time
- **Turn**: time needed for a simple action
- **Scene**: compact series of actions that take place in a single location or between a set of characters
- **Session**: pretty self-explanatory, sometimes referred to as a chapter
- **Story**: a full tale, with introduction, rising action, and climax
- **Chronicle**: a series of stories connected by the characters and an ongoing narrative


### Simple Tests

- generally, stressful activities require dice rolls
- Dice pools are used and determined by the storyteller, and a difficulty is set by the storyteller
-  **Automatic Wins**: if a character's dice pool is 2x the difficulty, the storyteller can make it an automatic win, however this seldom applies to combat or other stressful situations
- **the action is accomplished if the number of successes meets or exceeds the difficulty, and the margin can determine extra damage or degree of success**
- Tests are created with 2 factors, often containing an Attribute and a skill or an attribute and a discipline. This is called a *Skill Pool*
- **VAMPIRES REPLACE NORMAL DICE WITH THEIR HUNGER DICE FOR EVERY POOL**
- **Difficulty**: how many successes are needed to accomplish an action, with 7 or more successes being nearly impossible (see [[Action Difficulty]] for examples)
	- sometimes equipment is needed to accomplish a task, and a modifier of +1 will be added for improvised equipment
- **Modifiers**: changing the size of the dice pool is when a circumstance changes for the *character*, while changing the difficulty is a change in circumstance for the *action*. Shifting the dice pool up or down by 2 dice has generally the same effect as changing the difficulty by 1
	- **CAP MODIFIERS AT + OR - 2 TO THE DIFFICULTY AND + OR - 3 DICE**
	- a +1 modifier is used if a character uses a special
	- **Teamwork**: if the group works as a team, you roll the largest dice pool among participants and each person lending a hand contributes 1 die (only if they have one or more dots in the skill involved)
	- The storyteller should be free to modify the dice pool depending on the acting of the character, especially for social rolls
- **Failing and Winning**:
	- If a roll fails but has any number of successes the storyteller may offer the PC to **win at a cost**. The consequences are generally pretty serious
	- If a character fails an action they can sometimes try again, however there has to be a reason to do so, such as getting better lockpicks after failing to pick a lock
	- Characters may spend 1 point of willpower to re-roll up to 3 regular dice on any skill or attribute roll
- **Checks**: generally rouse checks or hunger checks, these only use 1 die and you aim for a success
- **Health = stamina +3
- **Willpower = Composure + Resolve**

### Contests & Conflicts

- If a PC opposes an SPC, it can be treated as a contest or the Storyteller can set a static difficulty level. The Storyteller can also **take half**
	- **Taking Half**: count the number of dice in the opposition's pool, then divide it in half and round down. This will be the number of successes the SPC got
- In a contest, both the acting character and their opponent build a dice pool, and whoever has the most successes wins
- **Who goes first?** If one side has surprise they always go first, otherwise it is a matter of urgency and proximity
- **ONLY AN ATTACKER CAN INFLICT DAMAGE** (if you're trying to dodge a bullet, you can't do damage to the shooter)
- If there is a tie, both parties are damaged with a margin of +1
- during ranged battle, without cover is -2 dice and superior cover is +1 or +2 (to defence pool)
- If facing multiple attackers, the player loses 1 defence die per opponent, and the dice pool must be split to attack multiple people
- **Common Die Pools for Conflicts**:
	- Strength + Brawl for hand to hand
	- Composure + Firearms for ranged weapons
	- Charisma + Persuasion or Manipulation + Etiquette for verbal conflicts
	- Dexterity + Athletics to dodge attacks
	- *see pg 129 of ebook for examples of rolls*
- **END CONFLICTS AFTER AROUND 3 TURNS**
	- break conflict: allow players to retreat 
	- have SPCs retreat if it makes sense
	- award victory to the side that won the most contests or the side with the least aggravated damage
	- change the situation (third party, new location, etc.)
	- Use one roll conflict (?)

### Reading the Dice

- **A SUCCESS IS A 6 OR HIGHER**
- **Critical Success**: 2 10s = 4 successes
- **Total Failure**: no successes - can result in normal failure or have dire consequences

### Damage

- in social conflict, the audience determines extra damage
- if weapons are used, the weapon's rating is added to the total damage
- Physical conflict damage = health, social conflict damage = willpower
- **Superficial Damage**: non-life-threatening injuries. Fists, kicks, and non-lethal weapons do superficial damage to humans while standard weapons do superficial damage to vampires. Causes bruising of the ego during social conflicts.
-  **Aggravated Damage**: life-threatening injuries. Sharp and piercing weapons deal aggravated damage to humans. Only fire, sunlight, and claws/teeth of some supernatural creatures do aggravated damage to vampires. Attacks from close friends or trusted figures, or attacks that reveal secrets about the victim do aggravated willpower damage.
- superficial damage is marked as an '/', while aggravated damage is marked as an 'X'
- once a character's tracker is filled, they are **Impaired**. They lose 2 dice from all relevant pools. Mortal players may be incapacitated at this stage. While impaired, all damage sustained becomes aggravated damage
- If a tracker is filled with aggravated damage, they become either comatose or dead (if mortal), or go into torpor.
-  If a tracker is filled with aggravated willpower damage while in a social conflict, they lose face and may have dire consequences invoked upon them, such as being exiled, losing status or merits, etc.

### Mending Damage

- Superficial willpower damage: remove superficial damage levels at the beginning of a session equal to composure or resolve rating (whichever is highest)
- Mortals can remove a number of superficial damage up to their stamina rating from their health tracker (only at the beginning of a session)
- **FOR MORTALS**: a character with medicine can convert aggravated damage to superficial damage
	- must succeed at Intelligence + Medicine, the difficulty is the total aggravated damage sustained by the patient and there is a +1 to the difficulty if you are healing yourself
	- The max points that can be converted is half the character's medicine rating rounded up
	- Hospitalization ignores dice rolls but takes weeks equal to the aggravated damage to heal fully
- Rousing the blood mends 1 level of aggravated damage (can do once per night)

### Levelling Up
 - at the end of each session, 1 experience point is awarded to the players
 - 1 extra point is awarded at the end of a story
 - xp points can be spent on traits or to acquire specialties
 - **YOU CANNOT SKIP BUYING A LEVEL**
 - [[Leveling up]]

### Character Creation
- Tip: **Do your research** 
- Ask some questions
	- what is your character's archetype
	- personality traits
	- why is your vampire with this coterie and why do they stay together?
- **Ways to create your character**
	- Show, don't tell: spend minimum time creating your character, then add more detail and reveal more about them as the campaign goes on
	- Session Zero: take a whole session with your players to create characters and give them some depth
	- The Prelude: run a session with the characters before they were embraced and paint a picture of what they were like. Delve into what their embrace was like. Other players are supporting cast such as relatives, friends, a sire, etc.
	- *see page 137 for character creation basics*
- **ALL COTERIE MEMBERS SHOULD BE THE SAME GENERATION**
- **Relationship Maps**
	- Used to visualize drama and relationships, keep track of supporting characters, and provide ammo for roleplaying. Can also come in handy for visualizing the political web
	- Black: PCs
	- Red: Fellow kindred; their havens and interests
	- Blue: mortals; their activities and bases
	- Example: ![[Selection_004.png]]
	- draw arrows from dominant party to weak party, and add how these characters feel towards each other
	- for PCs, have one positive line drawn and one negative per character. Add sires as well and some basic info about them such as clan, year of embrace, sect position, and the type of embrace (accidental, groomed for power, tortuous embrace, etc)
	- SPC adds 2 npcs and positive and negative connections, as well as info similar to the sire info
- **Attribute Point Buy**: best attribute uses 4 dots, three attributes have 3 dots, four attributes have 2, and your worst attribute has 1
	- add 3 to stamina for health
	- add resolve + composure for willpower
- **Skills**: think about what your character probably knows how to do based on their background and past life experience
	- **Professional Skills**: your profession gives you 2 skills at 3 dots and 2 2-dot skills
		- specialties give a bonus to tests of the skill if it relates to the action
		- when you acquire your first dot in Academics, Science, Craft, or Performance, take a specialty
		- choose a professional specialty in one of your professional skills
	- **Life Event Skills**: what major life events shaped you? take a 3-dot and a 2-dot skill
	- **Leisure Skills**: Hobbies, interests, things you regularly did for fun. Take 3 1-dot leisure skills
	- ![[Selection_005.png]]
	- **Extra Skills**: take one of the below: 
		- **Specialist**: 1 or more skill at 4-dots. If you want, you can change your professional specialty to a specialty of this skill. You can't move a free specialty from academics, craft, performance, or science to a different skill
		- **Generalist**: take 2 or more 2-dot skills and 4 more 1-dot skills
		- **Try to come up with a reason for why your character has these skills**
- **Convictions**: core values, a set of moral principles your character follows to connect to their humanity. They often begin with "never" or "always". make 1-3 of these
	- examples: killing, love, loyalty, core ideals, political principles, religious codes, etc.
	- how did they become important to you?
- **Touchstones**: who ties you to your humanity? Who would you risk everything to see again? Whose face keeps you from killing an innocent when mad with hunger?
	- pick as many mortals as you have convictions. These people serve as examples of these convictions
	- Write your touchstones on the relationship map
- **Ambition**: what was your greatest aspiration as a human? 
- **Names**: do you have a fake identity you use with mortals because you have a death certificate or because you're old enough for it to be impossible to use your old name? Do you have a name you only use in Elysium or among other kindred?
	- could be your life name, a latin name indicating your adoption into a powerful lineage, or a gang handle
- **Make excuses for why mortal acquaintances don't see you during the day**, and think of nocturnal job opportunities. Otherwise, think of nocturnal habits and archetypes, for example a gambling addict, sex worker, illegal immigrant, homeless person, etc.
- **Blood Potency**: 
	- 14, 15, 16th gen: 0
	- 12, 13th gen: 1
	- 10, 11th gen: 2
- **Humanity**: how close are you to human? How close are you to succumbing to the beast?
	- PCs start at humanity 7, or possibly 8 if they are all fledglings
- **Disciplines**: pick 2 disciplines related to your clan, then put 2 dots in one and 1 dot in the other. Pick a power for each dot.
- **Predator Type**: choose a predator type. If a predator type adds a specialty you lack the matching skill for, add a dot to the skill instead
	- many fledglings and thin-bloods do not choose a predator type
- **Beliefs**: do you keep your old ambition from life? Write a twisted kindred version of it down. Otherwise write a kindred-style ambition instead
- **Advantages**: choose up to 7 advantages from the merits section and the backgrounds section
	- advantages need to be relevant to your character
	- the storyteller may restrict advantages or decide some backgrounds be mandatory
	- you musst take at least 2 points of flaws
	- **Choose a loresheet**
	- give each player 1 (or 2 for small groups) coterie dot. These and any leftover advantage dots go into your coterie
	- *see page 153 for a summary sheet of attributes, disciplines, coterie types, backgrounds, and predator styles*
- **Experience**: Neonates get 15 xp each at character creation, and Ancillae get 1 dot in blood potency, 2 dots of advantages, 2 dots of flaws, and subtracts 1 dot of flaws. They also get 35 xp to spend
- **Appearance**: turn traits into physical appearance. High charisma - good looks, high int - piercing gaze, etc.
- **Equipment**: let people shop for items within their resources
	- those who don't shop can make an intelligence + resources or manipulation + streetwise check to see if they have access to equipment
- add some quirks for depth
